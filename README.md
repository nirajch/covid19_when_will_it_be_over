# When will COVID-19 end? 

This is a tiny project that I am working on with the goal of helping people answer these three questions: 

- What's a reasonable estimate (calculated, not hearsay) about when things will return to normal?
- How many of us are at risk?
- How much should I worry? 

Also, these questions should be answered for every country, based on latest WHO data.

The details of the model are in the web app itself. Please[send me an email](mailto:chanda.sayonsom@gmail.com) if you have suggestions on improving this web app.
